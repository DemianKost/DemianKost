### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are links for my content: demian.party(official website), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/demian-kostelny/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@demian.kostelny)

I'm a full-stack web developer with 3+ years of experience. My interest in technology started when I was only 10 years old, and I remember how I tried to write simple web pages only with a few HTML tags. That is how my story begins ðŸ™ƒ

So, as I said - for now, I'm full-stack developer, and here is a list of technologies that are in my stack:
- PHP + Laravel (like the main framework)
- WordPress
- Design Patterns
- OOP and SOLID
- HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
- JS, jQuery
- Vue.js (as the main js-framework for front-end)
- Shopify development

Also in 2018, I wrote my own book "PHP Junior Kit", and this book is good for everybody who wants to learn PHP as a beginner (you can find this book in Google Play).
