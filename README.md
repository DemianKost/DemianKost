### Hi there 👋

Here are links for my content: [Official Website](htts://demian.party),[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/demian-kostelny/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@demian.kostelny)

I'm a full-stack web developer with 3+ years of experience. My interest in technology started when I was only 10 years old, and I remember how I tried to write simple web pages only with a few HTML tags. That is how my story begins 🙃

So, as I said - for now, I'm full-stack developer, and here is a list of technologies that are in my stack:
• PHP + Laravel (like the main framework)
• WordPress
• Design Patterns
• OOP and SOLID
• HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
• JS, jQuery
• Vue.js (as the main js-framework for front-end)
• Shopify development

Also in 2018, I wrote my own book "PHP Junior Kit", and this book is good for everybody who wants to learn PHP as a beginner (you can find this book in Google Play).
