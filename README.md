I'm Middle PHP Developer with 3+ years of experience in E-Commerce development. Welcome to my official GitHub profile, where you can explore everything about my professional skills, latest posts and articles.

Let me introduce myself from a technical perspective. Here is a list of all the skills I use or have experience with development:
- Laravel/Symfony (as main PHP frameworks)
- Livewire/Inertia.js (best libraries for UI and monolith architecture for Laravel)
- WordPress CMS (custom theme/plugin development, full website development cycle)
- Design Patterns (in most cases I've used the most common, but this depends on the project)
- Full understanding of OOP and SOLID/DRY principles
- CQRS (event sourcing case), DDD (best practices that I'm using for clear architecture)
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (types of databases that I'm using)
- PHPUnit, Pest (for writing tests)
- SQL Language (understanding of creating queries, indexes, transactions, etc.)
- Redis (used as vector store or cache storage)
- ElasticSearch (as vector store for Python/Langchain app)
- AWS: S3 Bucket, DynamoDB, Pipeline
- Clear JavaScript, jQuery
- HTML/CSS (pretty simple and common skill for all developers)
- Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS as favorite CSS frameworks for UI
- Vue.js (as the main front-end framework)

Also in 2018, I wrote my own book "PHP Junior Kit", and this book is good for everybody who wants to learn PHP as a beginner (you can find this book in Google Play).
